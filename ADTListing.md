# Abstract Types

## Types

1. Unsorted List (Put, Delete, GetLength, iterators, and etc)
  a. Array
  b. Linked
2. Sorted List (Put, Delete, GetLength, iterators, and etc)
  a. Array
  b. Linked
  c. BSTArray
  d. BSTLinked
3. Stack (Push, Pop, and etc.)
  a. Array
  b. Linked
4. Queue (Enqueue, Dequeue, and etc.) - Pretty much an unsorted list, but same operations are slightly different
  a. Array
  b. Linked
5. Binary Search Tree ADT (Interface declaration)
6. Priority Queue
  a. Unsorted Array List
  b. Unsorted Linked List
  c. Sorted Array List
  d. Sorted Linked List
  e. Binary Search Tree
  f. Heap Array
  g. Heap Link
7. Graph
  a. Directed Graph (from math)
  b. Undirected Graph (from math)
8. Set
9. Custom/Specialized (Application specific)

## Bounded vs Unbounded ADT

An list created with an array or linked list can be either bounded or unbounded. Bounded means that the list should throw an error when
the maximum amount of items has been reached. Unbounded means that the list can have an unlimited amount of items.

## Exercises

1. Large integer ADT

NOTE: "Abstract Data Types are about exposing behavior to a user. Constrast that with a data structure which is a concrete representation of
data from the point of view of the implementer." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type
